# Structure

## /helmfile.yaml

The file for helmfile that describes the deployment.
This is a very generic one that can read the configuration from the `config` directory.
There are the definitions of the application Helm charts and the configurations.


# Deployment #

## Prerequisites

The following tools have to be installed on your system which executes the deployments:

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm)
- [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile)

## Deploy the applicaation

```bash
helmfile apply
```


This script is very generic and uses configurations from the environment to deploy each application.

Under the `/config/environment` directory you can find the configuration of the modules for the environments.

In `/config/values/{chartname}/` you can find one `values.yaml` which contains the default values and a `values.{environment}.yaml` file which contains environment specific overwrites.

The Ingress routing will be configured in the `ingress.yaml` file.
